# Welcome to PDOS!

If you're a new student you should introduce yourself to the rest of the group! Please don't feel shy about going around the PDOS open lab space and getting everyone's name and what they do. You'll need to get on COVID Pass and complete a COVID test to get access to the building first.

To get you access to various things, send the following to **Lily Tsai** (tslilyai@mit.edu):

1. the email address you want to use for the group mailing list, <pdos@csail.mit.edu>,
2. your GitHub username,
3. if you don't want to use your GitHub public key for our git server, send a different public key.
4. sign up for an account on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/), which we use for
   chat (including specific projects), and send your username.
5. website url, if you have or want one to be associated with your name on our website
6. any dietary restrictions

After you've done this, you'll have access to the [Getting started guide](https://github.com/mit-pdos/wiki/blob/master/new-student-getting-started.md) on the PDOS wiki, which you should read all the way through.

_note for current students: go through the [new student checklist](https://github.com/mit-pdos/wiki/blob/master/onboarding/new-student-checklist.md)_
